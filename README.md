I create 3-D models on an online CAD Software called "Onshape". From there I export an `stl` file in binary format. Then I use a slicing software (Ultimaker Cura) to generate a `.gcode` file which is fed to my 3D-printer via a SD card. You can customize settings for you printer and requirements like fill %, support structure, temperature of bed and nozzle, resolution etc.

# 3D-Printing Project List So Far:-
- `Customized Tool-Holder` to hold tools like allen keys, spanner, spatula etc. so that everything is organised and at one place.
