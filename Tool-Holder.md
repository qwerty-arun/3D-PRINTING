I made a customised Tool-Holder which mounts to the top frame of my 3D printer. 
- There were T shaped grooves on the frame. So for the base of my tool-holder, I made a T joint, which can slide through the guide way and also will not fall.

- There are 5 hexagonal shaped holes to hold the allen keys in place, 2 circular holes of different diameter to hold a screw driver and nozzle cleaner(thin needle), 2 slant grooves to hold two spanners.
